# Some Topic Notes

Simple shell script to create 2 based Protobuf topics.

pb_salesbaskets
pb_salespayments

Make sure to populate .env with the name of the docker-compose environment.

## For Schema Registry

I used the 2 below *.sh and *.json to create the schema entries for the Pb source topics, in another life/version this will be used to create Avro schema's once I create a Arvro version of all of this.
