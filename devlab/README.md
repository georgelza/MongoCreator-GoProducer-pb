# Some docker-compose Notes

This directory includes a docker-compose.yml file which can be used to spin up a local flink cluster in addition to a local mongodb, mysqldb & postgresqldb.

Take note of the .env file which is used to name the compose project, allowing the file to be moved around if required.

Note the same .env file is located in the Topics directory to allow the docker-compose commands to know which compose project to use.
